## Original User Request:
Design a high-fidelity web and mobile prototype for a next-generation tax and financial management platform tailored for Colombian businesses. The interface must include a clean, professional dashboard displaying financial analytics (income vs. expenses), intelligent tax alerts, smart invoicing status, and downloadable dynamic reports. Core modules include: client management, electronic invoicing, automated tax declarations, and company settings. Add innovative features like a virtual assistant powered by AI for guiding users through tax processes, automatic data classification from uploaded documents, and financial health indicators with actionable insights.

Visually, the design should feel modern, elegant, and enterprise-readyâ€”using a sleek layout with a sidebar navigation, cards with smooth shadows, and dynamic charts. Use a refined color palette with navy blue (#1E2A38), light gray (#F4F5F7), white (#FFFFFF), emerald green (#2ECC71) for success states, and soft red (#E74C3C) for warnings. Incorporate clear iconography, minimalist UI components, and elegant sans-serif fonts. The platform must support responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile views. Prioritize usability for non-technical users: every section should be intuitive, accessible, and optimized for productivity. Include a quick navigation menu, tooltip-based help, and interactive UI feedback. The design should stand out by combining modern visual identity with cutting-edge features, creating a user experience superior to traditional accounting tools.
